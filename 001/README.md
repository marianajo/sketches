# random fly (#001)

assignment of session #1 of The Nature of Code course @ kadenze.

## conception

it began as a pure technical experiment on random walk and Perlin Noise. the object could be anything. i decided to explore de random aspect of the work, so the walker is made from a random quadrilateral and random colours. i realized it looked like a flickering bird, so i decided to call the project *random fly*.
